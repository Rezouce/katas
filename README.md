## Convert latin number to roman number

From a latin number (like 1954), we want to be able to retrieve the corresponding roman number (MCMLIV).

You can see my way to solve it by looking from the commit [841dd27](https://github.com/Rezouce/katas/commit/841dd27619f36dbf9d4ba4ee3637855023e40f9f) to [137f04f](https://github.com/Rezouce/katas/commit/137f04f82b0691a054b088469e11e3b6f245968a) (8 commits).

## Find highest prime number composing a number

From a given number, which should find the highest prime number composing it.

Some examples:
- From the number 2, the highest prime number is 2.
- From the number 25, there are 2 primes numbers, 2 and 5, so the highest is 5.
- From the number 18572 there are 4 primes numbers, 5, 7, 2 and 857, so the highest is 857.

You can see my way to solve it by looking from the commit [b6ccf34](https://github.com/Rezouce/katas/commit/b6ccf34673332eef2b9f014764b9df057eb940a0) to [92d2064](https://github.com/Rezouce/katas/commit/92d206419dfa6030a8c549cc3c71b158a9ad78ff) (39 commits).

## Draw a spiral

The task is to create a NxN spiral with a given size.

For example, spiral with size 5 should look like this:
00000
....0
000.0
0...0
00000

And with the size 10:
0000000000
.........0
00000000.0
0......0.0
0.0000.0.0
0.0..0.0.0
0.0....0.0
0.000000.0
0........0
0000000000
